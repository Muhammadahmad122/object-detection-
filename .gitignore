### 3. `.gitignore`
This file ensures that certain files and directories are ignored by Git and not uploaded to GitHub. Here's a clean, well-structured `.gitignore`:

```gitignore
# Ignore virtual environments and cache files
venv/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyo

# Ignore IDE files
.vscode/
.idea/

# Ignore system files
.DS_Store

# Ignore Jupyter Notebook checkpoints (if any)
.ipynb_checkpoints
